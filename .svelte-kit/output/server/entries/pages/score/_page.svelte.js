My son Alex taught it to me a decade ago, when he was in middle school. I decided to make an online multi-player version.</p> <p>After some messy experiences developing a server with other\tprogramming languages, I turned to Haskell for the robust and easily maintainable backend that carried me through several experiments with various front ends. The server can handle a large number of \tnumber of groups of interacting players. Each group has its own chat box and shared todo list, and all members always see the same dice roll as it gets whittled down by players selecting numbers.</p> <p>One of my fondest memories began with Alex asking me to to devise a way to display all solutions to a dice roll or else report that no solution exists. My initial impression was that an algorithm that could so that would be unreasonably complicated and resource intensive. But not long afterward, I was delighted -- maybe "euphoric" is the right word -- as I showed Alex a button on the player interface that would abort gameplay and display every way to get 20 in two or three steps. It even broke the solutions down into categories. My appreciation of the Haskell programming language continued to grow.</p> <p>In the online game, players can gain a point by\tclicking "Impossible" unless another player finds a solution. In that case, the player who clicked "Impossible" loses a point. Players can change the default number of dice sides from 6,6,12,and 20 and the goal from the default\tvalue of 20.</p> <h2>About this Solitaire Version</h2> <p>This demonstration doesn't rely on a remote server, nor does it feature any Haskell code. It's just a little solitaire game providing an opportunity to consider the interesting possibilities of closures. You can traverse the history of game play for the current roll. If you make a\n        mistake, you can take back your move and do something else. If you traverse back and forth very\n        far, subsequent computations will be very slow and the program might even crash. If you just take back a move, computations proceed normally.</p> <p>The function fu() is the brains behind the game of Score. Each time a number or operator is\n        clicked, m2(fu) is called, the monad m2 is modified, and the change is reflected in the DOM. The\n        state of play in M is an array of seven arrays. Let's call it ar. If an operator op is in ar[2]\n        and two numbers a and b are in ar[1], fu calls calc(a,b,op) and the result is added to ar[0] and\n        ar[3]. ar[0] are the numbers in the game interface. ar[3] hold numbers that have been computed. At\n        least one of the numbers in ar[3] has to be used to compute 20 in order to gain a point. If the\n        number of points reaches 5, fu causes "You win" to be displayed, sets the score back to 0, and\n        calls runRoll, starting another round of play.</p> <p>At the end of fu(), two formatting functions are Called. The first, update(), refreshes the game\n        buttons, causing them to reflect the current state of ar. The second hides buttons that correspond\n        to values of undefine and shows buttons that correspond to numbers in ar. This is done by\n        switching variables p in "style = 'display: p' back and forth between "none" and "inline".</p> <a id="scoreDef"></a> <pre class="svelte-6bq8z1">function fu (a) {                  // fu\n      a[5].push(clone(a));\n      a[7].push(clone(a)); // All game states for use in "Back" and "Forward."\n      a[6][0] += 1;\n        // a[1].push(a[0].pop());\n      var result;\n      SCORE = a[4];\n      var a1;\n      if (a[1].length === 2 &amp;&amp; a[2].length === 1)   {\n        a1 = a[1];\n        result = calc(a[1][0], a[1][1],a[2][0]);\n        a[0].push(result);\n        a[3].push(result);\n        a[1] = [];\n        m2 = M(a);\n      }\n    \n      if (a[1].length === 3) {\n        a[0].push(a[1].pop());\n      }\n    \n      if (result == 20 &amp;&amp; intersection(a1, a[3]).length > 0) {\n          if (SCORE === 4) {\n              ZWIN = "You win!

That's the reason, toward the end of fu(), that the intersection of a[0] and\n        a[4] is examined when 20 is computed. Here are the first few functions called when a number is\n        clicked:</p> <pre class="svelte-6bq8z1">var click0 = a => {\n        a[1].push(a[0][0])\n        a[0].shift();\n        m2 = M(a);\n        m2(fu);\n        // sfunc();\n    };\n    \n    var click1 = a => {\n        a[1].push(a[0].splice(1,1)[0]);\n        m2 = M(a);\n        m2 = m2(fu);\n    };\n    \n    var click2 = a => {\n        a[1].push(a[0].splice(2,1)[0]);\n        m2 = M(a);\n        m2 = m2(fu);\n    };\n    \n    var click3 = a => {\n        a[1].push(a[0].splice(3,1)[0]);\n        m2 = M(a);\n        m2 = m2(fu);\n    };\n    \n    function clic0 (m) {\n      EEE = "add";\n      m[2] = "+";\n      m2 = M(m) ;\n    }\n    \n    $: clic1 = m => {\n      EEE = "subtract";\n      m[2] = "-";\n      m2 = M(m) ;\n    }\n    \n    function clic2 (m) {\n      EEE = "multiply";\n      m[2] = "*";\n      m2 = M(m) ;\n    }\n    \n    function clic3 (m) {\n      EEE = "divide";\n      m[2] = "/";\n      m2 = M(m) ;\n    }\n    \n    function clic4 (m) {\n      EEE = "concat";\n      m[2] = "@"\n      m2 = M(m);\n    };</pre> <p>The first line of fu() is the calculation result that is generated whenever there are two items in\n        (s)[1] and an operator in m2(s)[3]. The intersection is important in fu()'s bottom test. If\n        "intersect", the intersection of m2(s)[1] and m2(s)[3], is empty intersect[0] returns false and\n        the last test in fu fails, even though 20 was produced on the second computation.</p> <p>If no operator has been selected, it's possible to click a third number. The program doesn't\n        complain, it just puts the number back for you with:</p> <pre class="svelte-6bq8z1">if (a[1].length === 3) {\n        a[0].push(a[1].pop());  // Returns a clicked third number.\n      };</pre> <p>If you roll the dice and keep clicking on the leftmost number, you'll see the numbers shift back\n        and forth on every try. The first element of m2(s)[0] keeps getting pulled out of the first\n        position and pushed back on the right.</p> <p>sfunc() does some more DOM housekeeping. The buttons with dice number come and go as their CSS\n        display strings are changed back and forth between "none" and "inline". fu() calls sfunc(). Here's\n        how it is defined:</p> <p>For solitaire version presented here, a function named "m2" will form a closure with M as\n        follows: "m2 = M(x)" where x = [ Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1,\n            Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1], [], ['+'], [], [0], [], [0], []]) m2 will consume functions\n        that, as the definition of M specifies, operate on x inside of M. x corresponds to the state of\n        game play. After each click on a number or operator button, m2(fu) is called. The record of prior\n        states kept in x[7] allows players to traverse the history of their choices.</p> <p>In the solitaire version of the game of score, x in M(x) is, as mentioned above, the array of\n        arrays [ [Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1, Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 1], [], ['+'], [], [0], [], [0], []] ] where x[0], x[1], x[2], and x[3] start out as four integers simulating a throw of two six-sided, one twelve-sided, and one twenty-sided dice. x[1] and x[3] contain the\n        number selected by the player, x[2] is the selected operator, and x[4] keeps track of the number\n        of successes until the player wins by reaching 5, x[5] contains all prior states as the player\n        selects numbers and operators and is used for reversing state a little or all the way back to the\n        original roll. x[6] is an index of where in x[5] play is taking place, and x[7] contains every\n        state during a round. using x[6] to travers the history of game play in both directions.</p> <h2>Why I Call Them "Monads"</h2> <p>I sometimes call functions returned by M "monads", much to the consternation of some "functional\n        programmers" who scoff at the idea that JavaScript could possibly have monads such as those\n        defined in the Haskell programming language. Neither my monads nor the Haskell monads are Category\n        Theory monads. Haskell monads insulate chained computation from the global space, consuming\n        functions that return new Monads. Mine happen to do the same thing. Haskell monads need to\n        navigate through various types but I don't bother with that. The definition of "M" shows that the\n        returned function responds to arguments that are functions and also to the string "Stop."</p> <p>In my opinion, trying to define JavaScript objects that resemble the basic monads found in the\n        Haskell Prelude module, amusing though it may be, isn't likely to produce anything very useful.\n        People who think Haskell, or the supposed mathematical category of Haskell types and functions\n        called "Hask", are actually Category Theory categories are mistaken. Category Theory inspired the\n        development of Haskell monads and it might not be merely coincidental that the monads I am about\n        to define are functionally similar to Haskell state monads, though superficially quite different. Both\n        transform state along pipelines isolated from their outer scope by operating on functions that\n        return new monads. Both preserve state for future transformations or for eventual use in their\n        outer scopes. Mine call functions in their outer scopes in order to update the DOM, not having to\n        wait to do it in a main() function. I'm not trying to mimic Haskell or any other functional\n        programming language. I'll probably stop calling my little closures "monads."</p> Caution: <pre class="svelte-6bq8z1">var s = ret;\n    var log = console.log;\n    \n    function M(x) {\n      return function go(func) {\n        if (typeof func === "function") {\n          x = func(x);\n          return go;\n        } else if (func === "stop") return x;\n      }\n    };\n    \n    var m3 = M(3);\n    \n    m3(async a => await 888); // m3(s) will return a Promise with value 888.\n    \n    m3(s).then(v => m3((z => v + 112)));\n    // m3(s) will return 1000 after the promise is fulfilled.\n    \n    m3(s).then(v => setTimeout(() => console.log("m3(s) resolved is", v,), 2000));\n    // The promise is still pending, so the value of "v" is 888.\n    \n    setTimeout(() => console.log("m3(s) is", m3(s)),0);\n    // This gets bumped to the bottom of the stack, behind (2).\n    // m3(s) is called after x has been updated to 1000.\n    \n    // Result:\n    16:13:15.590 m3(s) is 1000\n    16:13:17.590 m3(s) resolved is 888\n    // Two seconds after "1000" appears in the console log, "888" is displayed.</pre> <br/><br/></div> \x3c!----\x3e`,a(e,l,"default",{}),e.out+="\x3c!----\x3e",o()}__name(requireInternal,"requireInternal"),requireInternal(),__name(_page,"_page");export{_page as default};
